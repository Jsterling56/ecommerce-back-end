# ecommerce-back-end

## Goals
The original point of this project was to construct the digital back end for an online webstore. 
We were to keep user data and display product info and prices.
Implementing the database was a real challenge, and I feel like I was very close to finishing. 

## Dependencies
MySQL, Sequelize, Express Handlebars

## Implementation
Code is currently unfinished. I wanted to submit to at least get a grade in the books. Something is better than nothing.

## Credits
Code is not mine. Credit & copyright goes to BennAsabir from github. ChatGPT was also used for some debugging purposes. As always, thanks to Rommel & Ringo.
